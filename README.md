# GreenGate

A WinForm application aims to check the Covid QrCode whether it is a Green one or Yellow one

# Small remark:
This application is built for researching purpose and no benefit, it can read the Covid QrCode generated by the mobile application "PcCovid" that written by VietNam goverment that including a QrCode with a background color [Green/Yellow] and a text with the information of how many doses injected
So please don't use this for another purpose as it won't give any result
As a developer point of view, you can try to use the app as a dummy software, read the code to look for something interesting

Thank you!
